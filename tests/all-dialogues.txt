======================================================================
CALLUM DIALOGUE TREE & QUEST FLOW
======================================================================

[TEST 1: First interaction - No quests completed]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Step 1: Player presses A near Callum
Speaker: Callum
Text: "You want work? I've got fish that need counting."
Choices:
  1. "Show me the work"
  2. "Not right now"

Step 2: Player selects "Show me the work"

Executing choice action...

📝 EVENTS TRIGGERED:
  ✓ showQuestMenu('callum') called
  ✓ startDialogue() called
    - Speaker: Callum
    - Text lines: 1
    - Choices: 1
    - Text: "Choose a task:"

📝 STATE CHANGES:
  ✓ game.state: exploring → choice

📊 CURRENT STATE:
  game.state = choice
  dialogue.active = true

⚠️  BUG CHECK #1: Double-click A to display tasks
   Current state: choice
   Dialogue active: true
   Expected: Quest menu should be visible immediately
   Actual: If state is DIALOGUE_CHOICE and dialogue.active=true, quest menu IS showing
   Issue: If A button handler checks for EXPLORING state, it won't work!


Step 3: Player selects "Check the Catch Records (100 coins)"
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📝 EVENTS TRIGGERED:
  ✓ startQuest('fishing_records') called
  ✓ endDialogue() called - Quest menu closed

📝 STATE CHANGES:
  ✓ game.state: choice → exploring
  ✓ game.state: exploring → exploring

📊 FINAL STATE:
  game.state = exploring
  game.questObjective = "Check the nets on the western beach"
  game.activeQuest = Set

⚠️  BUG CHECK #2: Tasks aren't explained after selection
   Quest objective: "Check the nets on the western beach"
   Expected: Should show "Check the nets on the western beach"
   This IS being set! So the objective should appear on screen.


Step 4: Player reaches western beach and answers correctly
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Player at (6, 8)
Calling handler.onUpdate()...

📝 HANDLER RETURNED:
  completed: true
  message: "You count 47 fish in the western nets, but the record says 58 fish were caught.

If 58 fish were caught but only 47 are here, how many are missing?"
  choices: 4

Choices returned:
  1. "9" 
  2. "11" ✓ CORRECT
  3. "13" 
  4. "15" 

Step 5: Player selects correct answer (11)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Executing correct answer's action...

📝 EVENTS TRIGGERED:
  ✓ showDialog("Correct! The records have been updated.")

📊 FINAL STATE:
  game.activeQuest.currentStep = 1
  game.questObjective = null
  game.state = exploring

⚠️  BUG CHECK #3: Menu freezes after correct answer
   The action calls showDialog() then setTimeout(() => advanceQuestStep())
   Problem: setTimeout won't execute in this test environment!
   In real game, if dialogue isn't properly closed, menu could freeze.


======================================================================
VERIFICATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

✅ DIALOGUE TREES MAPPED:
   ✓ Marlowe: 5 states tested
   ✓ Callum: Quest flow traced end-to-end

⚠️  POTENTIAL BUGS IDENTIFIED:

1. DOUBLE-CLICK A BUG:
   Root cause: Quest menu puts game in DIALOGUE_CHOICE state.
   If A button handler only works in EXPLORING state, player must:
     - Press A once to close dialogue (back to EXPLORING)
     - Press A again to advance

   Fix: A button should work in DIALOGUE_CHOICE for advancing choices

2. TASKS NOT EXPLAINED BUG:
   Quest objective IS being set: "null"
   If it's not showing on screen, the issue is in rendering, not logic.

   Check: Does renderingSystem.js show questObjective text?

3. MENU FREEZE BUG:
   Choice action calls showDialog("Correct!") then setTimeout
   Problem: If dialogue closes after setTimeout, timing issue

   Fix: Don't use setTimeout - immediately call advanceQuestStep()
        or ensure dialogue properly chains
